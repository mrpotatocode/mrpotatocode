Hi. Iâ€™m MrPotatoCode. This is a Github README.

I am working on my Master of Information in Human Centered Data Science at the [University of Toronto iSchool](https://ischool.utoronto.ca/current-students/programs-courses/programs-of-study/master-of-information/human-centred-data-science-hcds/).

Professionally, I am working for [Readout Health](https://mybiosense.com/) doing some client clustering and analytics work as a Data Scientist. That work is in a private repo, and is done in Python. 

Prior to that, I worked recently at [Plan International Canada](https://stories.plancanada.ca/) as a SQL based Data Engineer. 

I am working on a personal R-based project with help from [Rohan Alexander](https://rohanalexander.com/) within this [repo](https://github.com/mrpotatocode/COFEE_COFFEE_COFFEE), so if you only have a moment, check it out. Hopefully it's further along than when I wrote this README.

I'm blogging (rarely) [here](https://write.as/mrpotatocode/).

I am working on a project with biosonification by listening to plants. [WAAAAAAVEYYYYYY](https://soundcloud.com/mrplantwave).
