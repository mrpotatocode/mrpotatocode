Hi. Iâ€™m Mr Potato Code. I don't know why I have a Github. 

I worked recently at [Plan International Canada](https://stories.plancanada.ca/) as a Data Engineer. 
Now I am a professional imposter in a data science concentration. For more information I'm on Reddit, but not telling you my username. It's not Mr Potato Code. No seriously that's someone else entirely. How do I convince you? Why would I link a Reddit with two comments? It's not that clever of a username. Believe what you want.
