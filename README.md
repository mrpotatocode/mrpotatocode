Hi. Iâ€™m Mr Potato Code. I don't know why I have a Github. 

I worked recently at [Plan International Canada](https://stories.plancanada.ca/) as a Data Engineer. 
I am now working for [Readout Health](https://mybiosense.com/) as a Data SK-ientist.  

Super importantly, I am working on my Imposter of Data Science degree at the [University of Toronto iSchool](https://ischool.utoronto.ca/current-students/programs-courses/programs-of-study/master-of-information/human-centred-data-science-hcds/). Do I know anything? Who knows.

I know SQL, Python, and R in that order.
I like to listen to plants. WAAAAAAVEYYYYYY.
