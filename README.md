Hi. Iâ€™m MrPotatoCode. This is a Github README, _updated Dec 2022_.

I work as a Senior Model Steward Partner at [Thomson Reuters](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en.html) implementing data ethics and governance in machine learning models. Previously I have worked as a data scientist/engineer/analyst at several non profits and healthcare organizations.

This winter, I am teaching [SQL](https://github.com/mrpotatocode/DSI_SQL) at the [University of Toronto Data Sciences Institute](https://datasciences.utoronto.ca/).

I finished my Master of Information in Human Centered Data Science at the [University of Toronto iSchool](https://ischool.utoronto.ca/current-students/programs-courses/programs-of-study/master-of-information/human-centred-data-science-hcds/).

If you're on my GitHub, my best public R-based project is within this [repo](https://github.com/mrpotatocode/COFFEE_COFFEE_COFFEE), so if you only have a moment, check it out. Here's its [Shiny App](https://mrpotatocode.shinyapps.io/TastingNotePredictions/). 

You can reach me via <a href="mailto:mrpotatocode@ttrroossee.anonaddy.com">email</a>.
