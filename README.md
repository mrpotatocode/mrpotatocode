Hi. Iâ€™m MrPotatoCode. This is a Github README, _updated Dec 2023_.

I work as a Senior Model Steward Partner at [Thomson Reuters](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en.html) implementing data ethics and governance in machine learning models. Previously I have worked as a data scientist/engineer/analyst at several non profits and healthcare organizations.

In 2024, I am teaching [SQL](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/02-intro_sql) at the [University of Toronto Data Sciences Institute](https://datasciences.utoronto.ca/). Almost all of my recent (public) GitHub commits are here. 

I finished my Master of Information in Human Centered Data Science at the [University of Toronto iSchool](https://ischool.utoronto.ca/current-students/programs-courses/programs-of-study/master-of-information/human-centred-data-science-hcds/).

If you're on my GitHub, my best public R-based project is within this [repo](https://github.com/mrpotatocode/COFFEE_COFFEE_COFFEE), so if you only have a moment, check it out[.](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2Fl3vRlInF7QViJNOow%2Fgiphy.gif&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=e2ab716ba4e4a8c118443bf4f2f6f54a2433bf9f1e647f8195f90414b3476a09&ipo=images) Here's its [Shiny App](https://mrpotatocode.shinyapps.io/TastingNotePredictions/).
